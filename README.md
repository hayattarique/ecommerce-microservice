# 🛒 Enterprise E-Commerce Microservices

> A production-ready enterprise e-commerce backend built using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Microservices following industry-standard architecture, clean coding practices, and enterprise software engineering principles.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is an enterprise-grade e-commerce backend designed to simulate how large-scale organizations build distributed systems. The application is developed using a microservices architecture with a strong focus on scalability, maintainability, security, and production readiness.

The project is being built incrementally using sprint-based development, code reviews, refactoring, and enterprise engineering practices rather than tutorial-driven development.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- Microservices Architecture
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Service Discovery (Eureka)
- Centralized Configuration
- Stateless JWT Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Shared Security Starter
- Shared Common Library
- Enterprise Exception Handling
- Reusable Auto Configuration

---

## 📦 Modules

- Authentication Service
- User Service
- API Gateway
- Config Server
- Discovery Server
- Shared Utility Library

---

## 🔐 Security

The application follows a **stateless authentication model**.

- JWT Access & Refresh Tokens
- Spring Security
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Method-Level Authorization
- Shared Security Infrastructure
- Enterprise Exception Handling

JWT generation is handled exclusively by the **Authentication Service**, while JWT validation and security infrastructure are provided through a reusable shared module.

## 🌿 Git Branching Strategy

The project follows a structured Git branching strategy similar to enterprise development workflows.

```
main
│
├── stage
│
├── qa
│
├── dev
     |── feature/...
```

### Branch Responsibilities

- **main** → Production-ready code
- **stage** → Pre-production environment
- **qa** → Quality Assurance & Testing
- **dev** → Active development branch
- **feature/*** → Individual feature development

Every feature is dev in an isolated feature branch and merged through Pull Requests after review.
